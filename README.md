# Surf_Ice-Challenge
## The Projects Purpose
The client W.Avy wants more data about weather trends in Oahu before he commits to opening his Surf/ Ice cream shop. More specifically he wants temperature data from June, and December to get an idea if the business will be sustainable all year round. 

## Project Results 
One Thing we can see from the charts below is that the average temperatures for June and December are pretty close. Which is a good sign considering that the temperature itself is pretty warm "Year Round". This means that people will be able to surf which will mean that there will be a demand for a surf shop. As for the ice-cream portion of the shop we can see that June's highest temperature hits 85 degrees compared to december's highest on 83 which is really close so no real concern there. But if we look at the minimum temperature in June which was 64 degrees, and the minimum temperature for December, which was 56 we see a bigger jump which means there may be some days in december where you might see less business.

## Wrapping it Up
Overall a business offering these two services would be pretty profitable in an area like Oahu because of the temperature and the synergy between the services being provided. You can go out on a hot day and surf some waves, and when you're done, you can return to the same place to get some refreshing ice cream.
